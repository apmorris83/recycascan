# Recycascan
I came up with the idea for a recycling mobile app that allows a user to scan the barcode of waste packaging and inform how to recycle it. The app also has a calendar feature showing the userâ€™s next bin collections and a map feature showing their nearest local recycling centres. Building the frontend involved learning React Native, and the backend was built using MongoDB and hosted using Heroku. I also designed the logo and graphics for the whole app.
